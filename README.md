# 🔐 Advanced Encryption Tool

A powerful, Python-based file encryption and decryption tool that uses the AES-256 algorithm to secure sensitive files. Designed for both personal and enterprise use, this tool ensures data confidentiality using modern cryptographic techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 **AES-256 Encryption** in GCM mode (secure and authenticated)
- 🔑 **Password-based Key Derivation** using PBKDF2
- 🧪 **Integrity Check** via authentication tags
- 🗃️ Supports **all file types**
- 💡 Lightweight and easy to use

## 🛠️ How It Works

- User provides a password.
- A secure 256-bit key is derived using PBKDF2 + Salt.
- The file is encrypted using AES-256 (GCM mode).
- The encrypted file contains: `salt + nonce + tag + ciphertext`.
- During decryption, the tool verifies integrity using the tag.


## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [PyCryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

Install dependencies:
